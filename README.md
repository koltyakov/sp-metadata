# SharePoint Metadata Tracker

The Metadata Tracker collects SharePoint API entity definitions (`/_api/$metadata`).

Entity definitions (`edmx` models) are stored in `./edmx`.

Schema comparison allows tracking "what's new in SharePoint Online" in comparison to previous releases and On-Prem versions.

SharePoint Online is tracked for Standard and Target Releases which allows detecting what potential changes API-terms would be applied shortly.
